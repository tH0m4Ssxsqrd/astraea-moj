      <description>Q: What programming language? A: Check the problem&amp;rsquo;s statement for the name of the expected file. If the file ends in .c, it is C. If the file stem is .cpp, then it&amp;rsquo;s C++, and so on and so forth. Q: I&amp;rsquo;m getting a &amp;ldquo;Runtime Error&amp;rdquo; result from the judge. A: A common cause for that is forgetting to return 0 at the end of your main function. Online judges check if your program finished successfully, and a return different from 0 means an error ocurred.</description>

What can be improved with this fork: There are a few points that I believe can receive improvements, so I&amp;rsquo;ll list a few:</description>
